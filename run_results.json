Die Papiermache-Masse kann man ja auch im Mixer machen, eventuell mit Toilettenpapier als Pressformen-Filter.\n+ Die Klemmpresse ist eher was für junge Kinder. Sie hat kaum Kraft. Erwachsene, Jugendliche, usw werden eher mit den Fingern weiter kommen als mit dieser Klemmvorrichtung. Man könnte sicherlich auch Schraubzwingen verwenden, muss man aber nicht.\n+ Das Plastik ist relativ gute Qualität. siehe vorherige Zeile ;-)\n+ Schade finde auch ich, dass nur zwei Formen beiliegen und keine Erweiterungen erhältlich sind. Vorstellbar ist, dass man mit anderen Bastelhilfen oder Kochformen weitere nette Dinge basteln kann.\n+ Mein Fazit war: Ich kaufte auch die Idee!

Mit Zeitungspapier, Klopapier und Kleister lustige Figuren herstellen und bemalen.\nDas Tomy Mache Magic Set verspricht schnelle Erfolge mit wenig Aufwand. Also alles ausgepackt und losgelegt.\nDabei sind sehr viele Sticker, zwei Glitzergelstifte, negativ-Formen, die Presse, ein Auffangbehälter für Wasser, ein Löffel zum Befüllen von Wasser und eine Anleitung.\nMan braucht nur noch ca 1,2 Meter Klopapier und Wasser. Schon kann es losgehen.\nDas Klopapier wird in kleine Fetzen zerissen. Je kleiner, desto besser das Ergebnis. Nun legt man die Fetzen in die ausgewählte Form. Bei uns war es das Ei. Die Fetzen werden so ausgelegt, dass sie das komplette Innere des Eis bedecken. Nun füllt man mit dem Löffel etwas Wasser ein. Das Papier saugt sich nun langsam voll und legt sich eng an die Innenwand der Form an. Nun legt man weiter Fetzen auf die nasse Schicht. Ganz nach alter Pappmache Gewohnheit.\nIst das Paper verbraucht, nimmt man die Gegenseite des Eis und drückt sie in die Negativform. Dieser \"Klotz\" wird nun auf den Auffangbehälter gestellt und in die Presse geschoben.\nNun heißt es drehen. Und zwar so lange, bis es zwei Mal klickt. Dann wieder Aufdrehen, Wasser aus dem Auffangbehälter schütten und das ganze Spiel von vorn. So lange, bis kein Wasser mehr im Auffangbehälter landet.\nDanach die Form vorsichtig rausnehmen, öffnen und das gepresste Pappmache-Ei herausnehmen.\nWir gaben es dann 24 Stunden auf der Heizung trocken lassen und bemalt.\nIch finde dieses Set toll weil man keinen Kleber braucht. Flecken von Druckerschwärze durch die Zeitung gibt es nicht. Man halt alles zum basteln zu Hause und es geht sehr einfach.\nDas einzig negative finde ich, ist dass es keine weiteren Formen gibt. Man kann nur Eier und Herzen machen. Ich hätte so gerne Erweiterungssets gekauft.\nAnsonsten kann ich es nur empfehlen, gerade für kleine Kinder. Macht super viel Spaß."

A trivia quiz, particularly one which is as interactive as this one seemed like an ideal idea. What this has proved to me however is that despite thinking I was a friends fan, (or at least I used to be around 25 years ago) I am not. I really struggled to answer a lot of these questions although I did have fun playing the game. My daughter, however, really enjoyed it and did particularly well.\nI do like the nostalgia aspect of this game, the fact that the game itself is in the shape of a VHS is a really cool idea (I think I owned the first 6 or 7 seasons on VHS way back in the day!). It’s a really good throw back to a classic comedy series which was a staple of my generations growing up.\nThe one thing I would say is that the impromptu challenges that the game throws at you are maybe more appropriate in certain circles, maybe a group of good friends rather than as a family game."

The tapping part is not suitable for babies as they would need to hold the spoon and hit the toy with a decent amount of force, that is why on the packaging it says 18+ months. The only mode that would be interesting for the younger babies is the one where it plays the song by itself.\nThe egg is 12 cm tall and 10 cm wide so it is safe to use around babies, however, the spoon could be a choking hazard. The battery compartment is safely secured with screws on the underside and the toy comes with batteries included, neat.\nIt is made out of sturdy plastic and is overall quality made."

There is just a music setting which would be perfectly suitable for a younger one with adult supervision as the music is quite nice and the eyes light up on the chick.\nThe chick arrives in demo mode which is really loud but when you change it to on the volume does decrease a bit.\nThere are 4 different modes; the music playing I mentioned above, funny sounds (chick noises, boing noises etc), a do-re-mi one where your little one taps the top of the egg to copy the chick and another mode which I feel is similar to the do-re-mi one in all honesty yet is called musical layer.\nThe chicks eyes light up when it is being tapped or when it is playing the music or silly sound effects and its a nice little toy albeit with limited play value."

It's quite loud even on the normal mode so is designed to be danced to, its not like a typical noisy toy that plays away passively in the background.\nAs for the toy itself it's fairly limited in what it does; you tap the top with a spoon and it plays music in sync. My 3 year old finds it a fun addition to when we do music time, I keep it in the box with her maracas, drum, tambourine etc and we play with it when making music but it doesn't really have a huge amount of play value beyond that.\nThis would make a good gift for toddlers that love making music, but it's quite loud and may bother others that don't like loud noises."

The hide and squeak eggs are small and easy for little hands to hold and also help co-ordination as they fit the two halves of each egg together.\nThis requires a lot less input from the child and while it will play different tunes as you tap the shell with the spoon or whatever the child finds to hit it with, that is about it. It is cause and effect but that is about all. The child will hopefully learn the songs but I do feel that the enjoyment is somewhat passive and th child will quickly lose interest.\nIt is a good sturdy toy that is well balanced and will not break easily with being dropped or pushed around by the child but I do feel that the appeal is a bit limited."

They randomly fail and cause the toy to clunk into the bath- which isn't a problem unless you're watching a horror movie while the kids are in bed and suddenly think a burglar is upstairs demolishing the bathroom.\nThe pie dish doesn't spin when the water hits it, unless you give it a bit of a push to start it off.\nThe sink part does work when it is pushed down, the only negative being that the suction cups are so plop, that one push sends it falling off the tiles.\nThe little pan is easy to use and the tiny scoop is a great way to encourage kids to use utensils.\nMy son loves it but doesn't play with it as it was intended. He tries to cook his bath ducks in it and fills the sink with all of my shampoo.\nIt is a cute little set but it really needs better suction cups for the tiling and could do with more water cascades as the ones on the oven for not very impressive no matter how much water you chuck on it."

He tries to cook his bath ducks in it and fills the sink with all of my shampoo.\nIt is a cute little set but it really needs better suction cups for the tiling and could do with more water cascades as the ones on the oven for not very impressive no matter how much water you chuck on it."

It’s great to find a bath toy that’s different from all the others on the market, no ducks or boats in site! So the pros and cons on this for us were as follows:\nPros:\n1. It’s brightly coloured and has lots to do on it\n2. The “oven” door opens but they can also put their hand straight through it if they don’t want to bother.\n3. The tap squirts out water\n4. The saucepan is actually quite handy for hair washing!\n5. It’s a well known/ trustworthy brand\nCons:\n1. There’s two big suckers on the back to hold it to the bath but they didn’t work well enough so it constantly slipped down, especially when she tried to push the tap down it instantly fell down. In the end I had to put it on the wall tiles and let it sit on the side of the bath and let the water run down that way as it was the only way to get it to stay in position. This meant our daughter had to stand up to use it properly in the bath which meant we had to hold on to her the whole time to stop her slipping.\n2. We couldn’t get it to make bubbles as directed, pushing the yellow button didn’t seem to do anything.\nOverall I still think despite the cons this is a great bath toy, my little girl who’s nearly 3 loves it and doesn’t put up any fuss when I say it’s bath time now which is great and well worth the £20 just for that!"

     "text": "The principle of this is quite nice. It is a set that really comprises of two toys, one is a working sink (with a tap) and the other a kitchen stove toy.\nThe sink is pretty much straightforward. It has a working plug that can stay open or closed. When the plug is closed, and there is water in the sink, the tap can be operated to pump the water and make it come out of the tap. This is quite clever and I quite enjoyed it myself! The operating of the tap does require some effort, so it could be difficult for smaller children and it could also be tricky depending on how high this has been stuck on the bath/wall, etc.\nThe kitchen stove is also quite ingenious in its concept. The pot has holes to use as a shower - I have with my daughter and she loves it! - but when placed on the hob carefully it then stops the water from escaping. Then the pushing of the big yellow button on the stove creates some ripples to the water, which if some bath gel is added to it, can imitate the effect of water boiling. There is also a pretend oven with a door and a cake dish that can be put in the oven. When the pot on the stove is turned a different way, then the water can flow through the holes and make the cake dish spin.\nOverall, this set is big, colourful and captures the child's interest. However, a bid minus is the suction power of this set. I have found it very difficult to make it stay on the bathtub itself, the bath wall, etc. Also, I don't know why they have used only two suckers rather than 4, which I would have thought would make more sense!\nOverall, a decent toy, let down by the suction power. However, if you, like me, find a way around it, it can offer fun to the bathing child and can spend that extra bit longer in the bathtub relaxing an playing!"

It is truly leading to so much bath time fun.\nI have found that a lot of the bath toys on the market now either stop working after a few weeks or go mouldy quite quickly- this however does neither, which I’m thrilled with. It attaches to the wall on a tiled surface with great suction cups; no batteries are required so no risk of water hazards.\nI would say this toy is more aimed at a girl rather than a boy because of the colour scheme, which I feel is a shame as toys really should be gender neutral.\nHowever, it promotes great role play- it consists of a bath time kitchen where the sink bubbles naturally when pressing the tap down, the saucepan again bubbles when on ‘the hob’ and it also has a spinning pie dish! It comes with a ladder and a saucepan which hook onto the side of the oven- it really has thought about the small details.\nIt’s a great toy that keeps my niece entertained for ages!\nAn extra tiny detail- the saucepan also has holes at the bottom which filter through to the spinning head which make the pie dish spin!\nA great bath toy that I’m really optimistic will last!\nPriced at £20 feels reasonable for a role play toy which so much attention to detail and extras.\nOverall we’ve been pleased with this and happy to recommend."

The item is too heavy for the two number cups. It needed 4 as a minimum and of better quality. The item slides down into the bath and is more of a submarine than a play toy.\nI’m currently searching Amazon for larger stronger suction cups to remedy the poor cheap options Toomie provide.

It was opened at the weekend and although she and my grandson loved playing with it I was very disappointed that one of the suction pads did not work as it was not uniform in shape. It kept sliding down the bath tiles and didn't adhere to the bath either. I now see that many have had the same problem. I planned to request a replacement but, annoyingly, this is not an option from the seller - which speaks volumes! I could have asked for a refund but my family decided to try it again and my son managed to make it adhere but it may yet be returned if it keeps happening.

L'enfant peut appuyer sur un bouton pour faire des bulles, comme si l'eau était en train de bouiller.

Tout fonctionne très bien, c'est orignal, amusant, costaud, bien fait... Le prix affiché à ce jour (25€) est tout de même une limite à ne pas dépasser selon moi."

The smallest parts here are the swords, which are safe, but, feel incredibly cheap and don’t really fill the holes / slits properly - you really have to jam them in hard, even then they look like they can fall out any minute...which isn’t great at all frankly. £10 might be a big ask, but it really should be better from Tomy.\nThe game itself is foolproof and fun, consisting of a barrel, afore mentioned cheap swords (4 different colours) and the eponymous pirate and that’s it! If nothing else, it’s an easy fun game for 10/15 minutes at a time and teaches your child the valuable lessons of sharing and waiting your turn. A pity those swords are so cheap!"

It’s cheaply made, the barrel is flimsy, the pirate either pops out in the 1st couple of swords or not at all. Because the barrel is so flimsy, you’ve got to hold it down in order to not knock it over when you put the swords in. Honestly, it’s a let down all in all. Waste of a tenner"

This was disappointing to them, as they really liked trying to make him pop!\nI wouldn't recommend this, I just don't feel like it will last long enough.

You have to snap the daggers out of a plastic frame so you’re left with plastic nodules sticking out which can be sharp. About 50% of the time it doesn’t pop up. And loads of the daggers don’t stay in when you slot them in the sides. They just fall out again. And as for packing away. It doesn’t come with a box so it’s a real pain as the daggers just lie around next to the main barrel part so it’s messy for storage. Wish I’d not bothered getting it."

The mechanism is so obvious and simple that the position for the pirate to pop is always the same if you fix it onto the pirate. Very boring. Also nowhere to store all the swords - that big barrel should be openable to double as storage for the little swords. Hard to press the pirate in for my almost four year old so the game always needs an adult to help insert it, and it’s just too predictable and therefore boring for the adult."

Pirate doesn’t always click into place and sometimes won’t pop by the end of the game so quality isn’t great! I remember the game being more sturdy when I had it as a child.

The green and yellow swords are too thin and do not offer any resistance when placing in the slots, falling out as soon as you let go. Very disappointing if this is indeed an actual TOMY toy but having used it briefly, I suspect this is a cheap knock off.

The box doesn't take up too much room on a shelf. My only gripe is that the pirate's head is brown, while his hands are yellow. Attention to detail is lacking here; but that doesn't really stop this game being as fun as I remember as a child myself."

We play a few games where the loser is the one who pops up the pirate (traditional style) and then a few games where the winner is the one who pops up the pirate.\nI've not tried it with adults yet, but think that it could possibly make a descent drinking game if the loser has to take a drink when the pirate is 'popped'.

The pirate it self does not sit properly therefore it does nog pop up properly. I bought this for my 18 months old son and he does not like iy at all. It is actually very disappointing"
